Ximera workshops are true **working** workshops where users and
developers at all levels of experience come together to create
something new.

# Ximera Workshop 10 (5/12-5/14)

**Location:** Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio  
**Dates:** May 12-14, 2025  
**Presentations:** Cockins Hall 240 (CH 240)  
**Workgroups:** CH 240 and Math Tower 724 (MW 724)


The Ximera Workshop 10 is a hands-on, collaborative event bringing together creators, educators, and developers to improve and expand the Ximera platform. Whether you're just beginning or have authored full courses, you'll contribute to shaping the future of interactive online math education.

We'll spend our mornings learning and discussing major topics, and our afternoons working together to build content, prototype tools, and draft new resources.
