The nonprofit {{site.data.foundation}} provides the technology and community
support for free and open mathematics education materials.  Built with
the support of instructors and faculty from multiple institutions, the
Foundation supports open educational resources (OER), curates existing
resources, and builds the technology that enables instructors to take
control of assessment.
